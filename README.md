# HBC-GraphicsGame
A game that uses the WebGL API to create an interactive experience in 3D. Written as an Honors by Contract project for CSC 350 Computer Graphics under the guidance of Dr. Salgian. The folder includes the scripts creature.html and creature v8.js, which are written by me, texture files, and the "Common" folder that is not written by me, but is needed for the program to work.

The program features a main character that the user can control via key presses. The ‘a’ and ‘d’ keys rotate the character left and right by the y-axis, respectively, while the ‘0’ numerical key moves it forward in the direction it’s currently facing. The ‘w’ and ‘s’ keys translate the character up and down, respectively.
The game also features a set of buttons. The first button called “Change view” toggles the view shifting the camera between the origin and a point at (0, 0.75, 2), which is 20.56 degrees
above the origin. The second button called “Jump to random” moves the first character to a random spot in the world. The third button called “Change color of color trigger” sets the color of a small cube in the world to a random color. When the first character moves to or through the location of the cube, or color trigger, it sets the character’s color to be that of the trigger. The last button toggles between 2 textures.
